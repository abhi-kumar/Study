# List of terms that appear in this tutorial

### Note: The terms are discussed in details in either of the tutorial folders. Here, their quick definitions are present.


1. Regression - a measure of the relation between the mean value of one variable (e.g. output) and corresponding values of other variables (e.g. time and cost).

2. Multi-collinearity - a state of very high intercorrelations or inter-associations among the independent variables. 

3. Autocorrelation - also known as serial correlation, is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. It is a mathematical representation of the degree of similarity between a given time series and a lagged version of itself over successive time intervals

4. Precision - It measures how accurate is your predictions. i.e. the percentage of your positive predictions are correct.

5. Recall - It measures how good you find all the positives. For example, we can find 80% of the possible positive cases in our top K predictions. It answers what proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?

4. mAP - Mean Average Precision. mAP is the metric to measure the accuracy of object detectors.
